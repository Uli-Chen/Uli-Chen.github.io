Iâ€™m a junior undergraduate at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, where I conduct research in the [MIC Lab](https://micxyb.github.io/) supervised by **Associate Professor Yuanbo Xu**.  
My research explores topics across **Information Retrieval (IR)**, **Data Mining (DM)**, **Recommender Systems (RS)**, with a focus on building smarter and more efficient systems to tackle the growing problem of data explosion in our digital world.
