I am currently a junior undergraduate student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University. I am conducting research at the MIC Lab under the supervision of Associate Professor Yuanbo Xu.
My research interests lie in Information Retrieval (IR), Data Mining (DM), Recommender Systems (RS), and Generative AI, where I aim to explore intelligent information systems that bridge data understanding and human-centric recommendation.
