Iâ€™m a junior undergraduate at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, where I conduct research in the MIC Lab supervised by **Associate Professor Yuanbo Xu**.  
My research explores topics across **Information Retrieval**, **Data Mining**, **Recommender Systems**, and **Generative Model**, with a focus on building smarter and more efficient systems to tackle the growing problem of data explosion in our digital world.
